## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on structuring semantic HTML and organizing CSS for better readability and maintainability. Here are some highlights:

- Grouped related elements (e.g., profile details and social links) into <div> containers for better structure and styling.
- Used descriptive class names like profile-header, social-links, and profile-footer to improve code readability.
- Improved accessibility by adding meaningful alt attributes to images, such as:

```html
<img
  class="profile-avatar"
  src="./assets/images/avatar-jessica.jpeg"
  alt="Profile picture of Jessica Randall"
/>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Exploring advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS Grid, for more complex layouts.
- Improving responsiveness to ensure designs look great on a wider range of devices and screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [A More Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - This article helped me understand and implement a modern CSS reset, ensuring consistent styling across different browsers. It was particularly useful for improving the base styles of my project.
